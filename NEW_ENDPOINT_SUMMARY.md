## 🔧 Enhanced Features in Existing Endpoints

### PUT /api/routes/{routeId} - Enhanced Smart Index Management
**Status:** ✅ Fully Enhanced  
**New Features:**
- 🚀 **Smart Index Conflict Resolution**: Automatically shifts conflicting stops
- 🎯 **Direction-Aware Processing**: Handles Northbound/Southbound separately  
- 🔄 **Null-Safe Operations**: Enhanced error handling for edge cases
- 📝 **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit trail of all changes
- ✅ **Robust Validation**: Coordinate and field validation

**Smart Index Management Examples:**

1. **Insert at Beginning (Index 0):**
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "stops": [{
      "latitude": -26.2041,
      "longitude": 28.0473,
      "address": "New First Stop",
      "busStopIndex": 0,
      "direction": "Northbound"
    }]
  }'
```
**Result:** All existing stops automatically shifted: 0→1, 1→2, 2→3, etc.

2. **Insert in Middle (Index 2):**
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "stops": [{
      "latitude": -26.1951,
      "longitude": 28.0312,
      "address": "Middle Stop",
      "busStopIndex": 2,
      "direction": "Northbound"
    }]
  }'
```
**Result:** Only stops with index ≥2 shifted: 2→3, 3→4, etc.

3. **Direction-Specific Insert:**
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "stops": [{
      "latitude": -26.1970,
      "longitude": 28.0320,
      "address": "Southbound Only",
      "busStopIndex": 1,
      "direction": "Southbound"
    }]
  }'
```
**Result:** Only Southbound stops affected; Northbound stops unchanged.

## 🎯 Practical Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Remove Duplicate Stops
**Problem:** Multiple stops with same index  
**Solution:** Use smart update to reassign indices

```bash
# Fix duplicate indices by updating each stop with unique index
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "stops": [
      {"id": 31, "busStopIndex": 1},
      {"id": 32, "busStopIndex": 2}, 
      {"id": 33, "busStopIndex": 3}
    ]
  }'
```

### Use Case 2: Insert New Stop Between Existing Stops
**Scenario:** Need to add stop between index 1 and 2  
**Solution:** Smart index management handles automatically

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "stops": [{
      "latitude": -26.1980,
      "longitude": 28.0350,
      "address": "New Intermediate Stop",
      "busStopIndex": 2,
      "direction": "Northbound"
    }]
  }'
```
**Automatic Result:**
- Previous stop at index 2 → moves to index 3
- Previous stop at index 3 → moves to index 4
- New stop takes index 2

### Use Case 3: Clean Route Reorganization
**Scenario:** Need to completely reorder stops  
**Solution:** Batch update with new indices

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "stops": [
      {"id": 30, "busStopIndex": 0, "address": "Starting Terminal"},
      {"id": 31, "busStopIndex": 1, "address": "Hospital Stop"},
      {"id": 32, "busStopIndex": 2, "address": "University Campus"},
      {"id": 33, "busStopIndex": 3, "address": "Shopping Centre"}
    ]
  }'
```

## 🔍 Testing & Debugging

### Complete Workflow Test
```bash
# 1. Get current route state
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1"

# 2. Add new stop with index management
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"stops":[{"latitude":-26.2041,"longitude":28.0473,"address":"Test Stop","busStopIndex":1,"direction":"Northbound"}]}'

# 3. Verify changes
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1"

# 4. Delete a stop if needed
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1/stops/{stopId}"

# 5. Final verification
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/routes/1"
```

### Debug Logging
Monitor application logs for detailed operation tracking:
```
INFO: Found 3 conflicting stops at index 2 or higher. Shifting indices...
DEBUG: Shifted stop "Hospital Stop" from index 2 to 3
DEBUG: Shifted stop "Campus Stop" from index 3 to 4
INFO: Successfully shifted 3 stops to accommodate new stop at index 2
```
